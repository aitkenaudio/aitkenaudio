With 20 years of experience, I specialise in the repair, restoration, and construction of guitar amplifiers and pedals to keep your tone alive and kicking. Whether it's a vintage amp in need of TLC or a bespoke pedal crafted to your specs, I've got you covered.

But that’s just the start. From hi-fi systems to PA equipment and electric guitars, no project is too big or small. Circuits can be tailored or upgraded to suit your preferences. Quality work, expert service, and a passion for great sound – that’s Aitken Audio.
