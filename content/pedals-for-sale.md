# Built for Tone, Designed for Style.

After years of design, research, and relentless tweaking, Iâ€™m proud to offer my own line of boutique effects pedals. Built for tone chasers and pedalheads, each one is crafted with high-quality components and features unique artwork by talented Sheffield artists.

You can grab these exclusive designs over on my Reverb Shop, where you'll also find other gear Iâ€™ve got up for sale. Check out my latest listings on my Aitken Audio Reverb Shop for the full selection.
