After several years of design and research, I finally decided to bring out an effects pedal line. They've been designed to be high quality boutique, visually appealing designs, with the artwork being produced by local Sheffield artists. The exclusive designs can be purchased from my reverb [shop page](https://reverb.com/uk/shop/aitken-audio) via a secure shopping cart check-out. I've got other stuff on there too. My latest gear for sale is displayed on the right of this page but check out [Aitken Audio on Reverb](https://reverb.com/uk/shop/aitken-audio) for more.

The Bear is an original overdrive design with its roots in the Proco Rat circuit. It provides supreme depth and versatility with its array of controls.
