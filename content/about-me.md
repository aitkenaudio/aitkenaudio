I’m Michael Aitken, founder and owner of Aitken Audio in Sheffield.

With years of hands-on experience and a deep passion for sound, I’ve been fine-tuning, repairing, and building amps and pedals since I was 16.

It all started when I couldn’t afford high-end gear, so I built my own! That curiosity turned into a lifelong obsession with how amplifiers work, and I’ve never looked back.

My first build? A Fender 5F6 clone which is still going strong today. Next came a 150-watt bass head of my own design, a powerhouse that saw me through countless gigs and tours.

Now, I put that same dedication into every repair and custom build, helping musicians get the absolute best from their gear.
