Hiya, I'm Michael Aitken, proud founder and owner of Aitken Audio of Sheffield.

With many years of experience and a wealth of knowledge fine tuned since I was just 16 years old, if you are looking to get the best sound out of your equipment, I'm your man.

The story began when I couldn't afford to buy good amplifiers and pedals so I decided to build my own. A natural curiosity of how all things amplifier related worked was born and I have never looked back.

My first construction was a fender 5f6 clone which is still going strong and sounds great today! My next was a 150 watt bass head of my own design which lasted many tours and gigs in my youth.

Many projects have been undertaken since this and I have recently started documenting all the work that I've undertaken which can be seen on my blog and Social Media links page.

No job is too big or small and I am happy to undertake anything from a simple service to a complete rebuild bringing your amps back to life and making them sing as 'good as new'. Why not call to discuss your job? [07918 666029](tel:07918666029)
